### How Neuroticism Shapes Stress Response

Stress is not just a product of external events—it’s deeply influenced by personality. In the Big Five model, **Neuroticism** measures emotional sensitivity, mood stability, and susceptibility to stress.

### High Neuroticism: Emotional Reactivity

Individuals high in Neuroticism often:
- Experience stronger emotional reactions to challenges
- Worry more about potential negative outcomes
- Have difficulty “switching off” after stressful events

**Tips for high Neuroticism:**

2. **Structured Problem-Solving** – Break overwhelming situations into actionable steps.
3. **Regular Physical Activity** – Exercise reduces stress hormones and improves mood.

### Low Neuroticism: Natural Resilience

Those low in Neuroticism tend to:
- Stay calm under pressure
- Recover quickly after setbacks
- Have a stable and predictable mood

**Growth tip:** Even with high resilience, it’s important to recognize that others may not cope as easily—empathy is key in relationships and leadership.
